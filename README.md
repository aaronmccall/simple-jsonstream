# simple-jsonstream

Need to output a stream of objects as a JSON array?

```javascript
var JSONStream = require('simple-jsonstream');

var jsonStream = myAwesomeObjectStream.pipe(new JSONStream());

// In hapi route handler
reply(jsonStream).type('application/json');

// In express
res.setHeader('content-type', 'application/json');
jsonStream.pipe(res);
```
